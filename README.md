# Celery Task



This is a sample project with a celery task to generate csv file.

## Getting started

To get started you can simply clone this celery__file_generate repository and install the dependencies.

Clone the ecommerce-demo repository using git:

```bash
https://github.com/noufida/celery__file_generate.git
cd celery__file_generate
```
Then install the dependencies:

```bash
(env)$ pip install -r requirement.txt
```
Note the ```(env)``` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by virtualenv2.

Once ```pip``` has finished downloading the dependencies:


```bash
(env)$ cd celery__file_generate
(env)$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
